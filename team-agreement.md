# Team Agreement

This agreement is to state the communication, conflict, work and git plans of our team. These go as follows:

## Communication Plan

During team meetings we will practice good speech flow, to ensure that every member has a chance to describe and express their ideas and suggestions. As for how we decide on what ideas to follow, after listening to what everyone has to say, we take a vote and decide on what everyone agrees is the best idea.

## Conflict Plan

We hold a group meeting to hear all sides of the story and then as a group we will decide the best action plan to resolve the conflict. However, when doing so we must ensure that no one feels like a less important group member.

## Work Plan

Tasks will be identified based on the plan we will draw up with our wireframe. Regarding, how tasks will be divided among the team members, we will set each team member as a coordinator for the parts that they have an advantage in so that when the team finishes work on the separate tasks, each coordinator will look over the complete tasks to make sure they are done and up-to standard. As for the project management tool we will use Trello to keep track of tasks and progress.

## Git Process

Regarding our Git Flow, we plan on managing this through our daily morning meeting. During our meetings, we plan on having a portion of the time to inform each other of what progress was made the day before and if the tasks were complete as assigned, as well as what we plan on doing in that day. After this is established, we will all do the pull requests for our current feature branches and then each create a new branch for that day. We will try to avoid conflicts by managing the tasks to minimize the number of people working on each file at the same time.

## Other

We expect to have catch up meetings at the end of each day to let each other know where we reached with our tasks. We expect constant communication with each other over slack to make sure no one is stuck and needs help.
